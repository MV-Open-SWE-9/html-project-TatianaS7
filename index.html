                <div id="about">
                    <p>I've dabbled in a lot of different fields, so some of my interests are art and design.
                        I was in the Fine Arts Academy at my high school, where I learned a variety of skills from
                        Photography and Painting, to Graphic Design and Drawing with different mediums. One of my
                        first projects when learning App Development was my art portfolio, because I wanted a
                        customized page that really suited me beyond Blogger or Wix templates. Feel free to check
                        it out! <br><br>I also help out with my family's business, <a

                            Photography</a> , whether it be
                        photo editing, handling email communications, or content curation. My grandfather was a
                        photographer from the 40s to late 90s, and captured some of the greatest Jazz and Blues legends
                        from that time period.

            <h1>My Experience</h1>

            <div class="flex">
                <div id="background">
                    <p>Before I became a Software Engineer, I started with User Experience Design. In 2021, I took a
                        6-month course
                        through eCornell, where I learned all the essentials of UXD, from ideation to prototyping.
                        Prior to knowing what UX Design was though, I had ideas for webistes and apps, but I was coming
                        from
                        a business background so I knew it wasnt feasible to start up all of these companies. What I
                        ended up noticing was
                        that I put a lot of focus on what the digital aspect would entail rather than the logistics as a
                        business.
                        This is what led me to look more into creative career paths, even considering product design. I
                        knew I was good
                        at planning out digital applications and I wanted to keep doing it. One day I came across a
                        TikTok about being a UX Designer
                        and it caught my eye, ultimately leading to me taking the course.<br /><br /> Once I finished my
                        first passion project,
                        I realized I wanted to be able to actually build it out, so I branched off to
                        the more technical side, learning <u>JavaScript</u>, <u>HTML</u>, <u>CSS</u>, <u>SQL</u>,
                        <u>Node.js</u>,
                        etc. This journey has been extremely fulfilling for me, just being able to develop these skills
                        and see how far I've come.
                        It's so exciting to see how I can incorporate my creativity into technology, and I look forward
                        to learning more and contributing
                        my knowledge to meaningful projects.
